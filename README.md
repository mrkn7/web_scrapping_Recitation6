# R Web Scraping and Interactive Mapping

This repository provides examples and tutorials on how to perform web scraping in R using the `rvest` 
package and create interactive maps using the `leaflet` package. These scripts are handy for students looking to 
develop skills in data collection from web sources and geographical data visualization, focusing on Turkish earthquake data from the Kandilli Observatory and AFAD websites.

## Description

The repository includes:

- **Web Scraping Tutorials**: Scripts demonstrating how to extract earthquake data from Turkish sources using the `rvest` package.
- **Leaflet Map Examples**: Samples showing how to plot scraped data on interactive maps, ideal for visualizing geographical information in STAT295 homework assignments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You should have R installed on your computer and RStudio for easier interaction. Additionally, install the following R packages if you haven't already:

```R
install.packages(c("rvest", "leaflet", "dplyr", "httr"))
